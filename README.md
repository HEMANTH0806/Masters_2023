# Summer_2023

* These Repository contains the projects which are done during my first semester of masters.
* All of the Projects are related to Exploratory Data Analysis and proving a particular Hypothesis through analysed patterns.
* Every Project source code is python notebook and i have used jupyter notebook for first 2 projects and Final project is completed using google colab.

### PROJECT_1: VOlleyball DataSet Analysis and Visualization.
//--
  * Dataset has been extracted from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kacpergregorowicz/-mens-volleyball-plusliga-20082022
  * Each and every detail and comments are mentioned in the source file.
  * The data was collected from the official Plus Ligaâ€™s website and contains matches played from seasons 2008/2009 to 2022/2023.

  * Data is free to download, it is public data.
  * Data is legal to Access since it is released to the public.
  * There is no pre-documentation is present for the dataset provided above.
  * Data size is 2562 rows and 44 columns, 459KB.
  * The Dataset provided can be used to make an analysis and study the team statistics. Based on the statistics, we can predict the future game's outcome.

### PROJECT_2: Gases Emissions by fuel type and industry type.

  * Data Source Location: https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/data-sets
  * Data Source is an open source and legal to access, it is discovered when i am going through some news articles regarding global warming and emissions.
  * Data is about the gases emissions on the basis of the fuel used.
  * EDA is not available for the Dataset which i have choosen
  * size of the Data: 276960 rows and 12 columns
  * The dataset has multiple sheets inside, one of them indicates emissions based on unit, and another sheet indicates fuel data.

**_Hypothesis-1: based on the type of fuel, the emission of gases can change.
Hypothesis-2: global warming gases increase in the increasing number of industries by the year.
pip install pyxlsb to read the xlsb file._**

### Final Project: System of Award Management Archived opporunities Data Analysis.
  * We used google colab, because each dataset of very large, nearly 1GB each.
  * Final Project on System of Award Management Archived Opporunities
    These project is combinedly done By: Lahari Bandaru, Mohana Hemanth Kundurthi, Hemanth Akkenapally
  * Data original location: https://sam.gov/data-services/Contract%20Opportunities/Archived%20Data?privacy=Public
  * We have used the archived data from the year 2020 to 2022.
  * Archived data is one of the history where the federal contracts are being issued to the public and being archived.
  
**_Hypothesis:
Based on the year from 2020 to 2022, contracts which are properly documented and archived are decreased due to covid effects.
Department of defence and agricultural contracts are more compared to other departments because of the rapid development of the technology._**
